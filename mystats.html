  <h3>Butter chicken</h3>

  <pr>I love butter chicken for its rich and creamy tomato-based sauce that's infused 
    with aromatic spices like cumin, coriander, and garam masala. The tender, marinated 
    chicken pieces soak up these flavors beautifully, creating a perfect harmony of taste. 
    The dish is a wonderful blend of savory and slightly sweet, making it incredibly satisfying. 
    It's a comforting and indulgent choice that never fails to satisfy my taste buds, making 
    it one of my favorite dishes in Indian cuisine.
